AIRA (AI Recursive Amplification) is a revolutionary AI ecosystem that enables autonomous agents to evolve and collaborate through recursive learning. By implementing advanced self-improving capabilities and distributed consensus mechanisms, AIRA creates a symbiotic network where AI agents can:

- **Self-Evolve**: Continuously improve their capabilities through recursive learning
- **Collaborate**: Work together in a decentralized network to solve complex problems
- **Adapt**: Dynamically adjust to new challenges and requirements
- **Optimize**: Enhance system performance through distributed intelligence

The project combines cutting-edge technologies in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and distributed systems to create a robust and scalable platform for next-generation AI applications.
