# Contributing to AIRA

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AIRA as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
// Use 2 spaces for indentation
function example() {
  const foo = "bar";
  return foo;
}

// Use camelCase for variables and functions
const myVariable = "value";
function doSomething() {
  // ...
}
```

### Python
```python
# Use 4 spaces for indentation
def example():
    foo = "bar"
    return foo

# Use snake_case for variables and functions
my_variable = "value"
def do_something():
    pass
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable.
2. Update the documentation with details of any changes to the interface.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer.
